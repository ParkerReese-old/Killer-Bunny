# Killer-Bunny
A game made during the hasty 48hrs of a game jam! To play the game as it stands rung the .exe file found at Evil_Bunny/Evil_Bunny.exe.
Killer-bunny was made in Unity and uses Evil_bunny as it's root directory. Not only was this game super fun to make during a game jam, but I also
got to work with people I have not met before, which was also exciting!
